# Quote
`It Is Our Moments Of Struggle That Define Us - Angel Gas Fallen`  
Some people also said we earn most of the money during a bear market. which kind of true in a way.
I feel more like how we deal with struggle and the low times that defines us. You gonna sink in or you gonna rebound? how deep you have to sink? It is a delicate situation that you can't sit there do nothing or flail your limbs like a mad man. It requires you to try different things and crawl out of it one step at a time. 

# Idea & problems

## How to convert this writing system to creating software?
I found this [Medium Post](https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-system-i-used-to-write-5-books-and-over-1-000-blog-posts-5872451d7461) quite inspiring. This got me into thinking how to convert this system into creating software. Always wanted to learn new things and work on side projects. But never really able to produce anything. And I really agree with this quote `The best practice is the kind done in public, and the best writing is the stuff you intend to publish.` The problem of creating software is it takes longer. Being able to iterate on the 3 step system in a few days and have a finished piece of writing must be satisfying. The long drag of learning something new and creating working software always kills the motivation for me. What to do?
1. Collect Ideas
2. Write and Save
3. Edit and Publish
